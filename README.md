# Java Lab 1

This is an introduction to Java programming language and part of the Java development course at the Vistula University.
The repository contains a simple program which prints "Hello Vistula" to the console.

## How to build

To compile and run the program you need to have a [Java Development Kit](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) installed.

```sh
# From the repository root:
❯ javac src/Main.java 
❯ java -classpath src/ Main

# Output:
Hello Vistula!
```
